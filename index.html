    <p>Bangladesh is a small country with a huge population. The total area of Bangladesh is 147,570 square kilometers
        but the total population is more than 164 million. Still, it is a green and naturally beautiful country. Our
        country is growing economically and it is doing well in export too.

        We are the leader in world garments exporting right after china. Not only in the economy, but we also good at
        sports too. Our cricket team is one of the top seven teams in the world. Bangladesh has a very heart touching
        history behind. In 1971 this country got independence from Pakistan after a nine months war.

        Lots of people sacrificed their lives in that time. On 16 December the Pakistani army surrendered and we got a
        new nation. That’s why we celebrate on 16 December as our Victory Day. Bangladesh is a very beautiful country
        with lots of natural spots to see. I love my country a lot. </p>

    <p>Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was a very important person for the people of Bangladesh. He was born in a
        small village in Bangladesh in 1920.

        He loved his country very much and worked very hard to make it free from the bad rulers of Pakistan. He was a
        very good speaker and leader who helped the people to come together to fight for their rights.

        He is known as the father of Bangladesh because he led his country to become independent. Even though he is no
        longer with us, we still remember and honour him for his great contributions to our country.</p>

        angladesh War of Independence
        The Bangladesh Liberation Movement Of 1971.
        Introduction: Bangladesh is now an independent country in South Asia. At a time, she was not free. She has
        achieved independence on December 16th, 1971. this independence is earned after much sacrifice. It has a painful
        and thrilling story. Because the people of Bangladesh fought for freedom with courage and determination and won
        a glorious victory in the time of only nine months.

        Background: When the British leadership ended in the sub-continent, the two countries rise. They were Pakistan
        and India. Again, Pakistan was made up of two separate parts. Their names were East Pakistan and West Pakistan.
        Both Pakistan’s were ruled by the leaders of West Pakistan. East Pakistan had a larger population than West
        Pakistan but it never got its due share in any place. The demands of its people always fell on deaf ear. So,
        unrest grew so fast and the leaders of public opinion expressed their complaints.

        The six-point programme: The most popular leader in East Pakistan, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, planed the six-point
        programme. For this reason, he was imprisoned. At least the government was obliged to release him.

        The general election of 1970: General Yahya Khan came to power and the general election was held in 1970. The
        Awami League won a complete majority. But Yahya Khan suspended the first session of the National Assembly. The
        Historical Public Meeting of 7th March: Sheikh Mujibur Rahman called a historical public meeting on 7the March
        1971. In this meeting, he asked the people to get ready with their weapons.

        Black night of 25th March: The night of 25th March was very dangerous to the people of East Pakistan. When they
        were sleeping at this night, the West Pakistan Army attacked them and Began killing them.

        Declaration of Independence: Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared the independence of Bangladesh on the 26th March
        1971. It is a Red-letter day in the history of Bangladesh. On that day he was arrested.

        Liberation War: The Pakistan Army began burning houses, looting wealth, raping women and killing innocent
        persons. They spread-out all-over Bangladesh. About 10 million people fled the country and took shelter in
        India. Some Bangladeshis determined to fight against the enemy soldiers. A temporary government of Bangladesh
        was formed with Syed Nazrul Islam as acting president. Colonel A.G. Osmani was made Commander in Chief of
        Bangladesh Armed Forces. Many people of all ages began to receive training in the use of arms at home and
        abroad. They formed a strong liberation force and became able to face the enemy successfully. After about eight
        months, the Indian forces joined with the liberation forces. The Pakistan forces surrendered to the combined
        forces in Bangladesh. General Niazi, Commander of the Pakistan Army, signed the document of surrender in
        Bangladesh on December 16th, 1971. As a result, Bangladesh arose as an independent state in the world.

        Conclusion: Now we are an independent nation. About thirty lakhs of people died for this independence. We
        respect them and never forget their sacrifice. They who sacrifice their lives for the liberation are immortal.
        So, it is our sacred responsibility to protect the freedom of our motherland.</P>

    <p>The National Flag of Bangladesh Paragraph; A national flag is generally the symbol of a free nation. Being a free
        nation, we also have a national flag of our own. It symbolizes our national integrity, solidarity, and
        sovereignty. In 1971, we got our national flag through a bloody war against Pakistan. The size/ length and
        breadth of our national flag is 10:6. Its shape is rectangular. It is made of cotton, linen, or silk. It bears a
        combination of two colors. The major part of it is deep green. There is also a deep red round color part in the
        middle of it. It looks like the rising sun.

        The green color of our national flag stands for everlasting youth, freshness, and vigor of the whole nation. It
        also symbolizes the ever greenery of our beloved country. The red round part of our national flag symbolizes the
        rising sun of independence. Our national flag is the source of our spirit, hopes, and aspiration for our youth.
        It is hoisted every day on our government offices and educational institutions. It is kept half-mast on our
        national mourning days. Besides, it is hoisted everywhere on independence day and victory day. We feel proud of
        our national flag.</p>
